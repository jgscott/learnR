### How many calories do people eat at Chipotle?

For this exercise, you'll need to download the following data set:   
* [burritos.csv](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/data/burritos.csv)  

This data set contains the calorie count for 3042 meals ordered from Chipotle through [GrubHub](https://www.grubhub.com).  The data set was screened for meals that are very likely to be for a single person (e.g. they contain no more than one main item like a burrito or order of tacos, perhaps in addition to one side item and/or one drink).

Use the R skills you've learned to answer the following questions.  

1. Make a histogram of the distribution of calorie counts so that the width of each bin is 40 calories.  Why do you think there are noticeable spikes at certain values (e.g. around 700, 900, 1000, 1600)?   
2. How many calories does the average meal at Chipotle have?   
3. What fraction of meals contain more than 1600 calories? (The FDA's recommendation for most adults is between 1600 and 2400 calories per day.)   
4. Quote an 80% coverage interval for the data--that is, an interval that covers the central 80% of the distribution.
