### Which bands come to ACL Fest?

For this case study, you'll need the following data set:   
* [musicfestivals.csv](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/data/musicfestivals.csv)  

This data set contains every band who played at one of the following five major music festivals between 2008 and 2011:  
- [Austin City Limits](http://www.aclfestival.com), or ACL, in Zilker Park in downtown Austin.  
- [Bonnaroo](http://www.bonnaroo.com), on a farm in Tennessee.  
- [Coachella](https://www.coachella.com), in the California desert.  
- [Lollapalooza](http://lollapalooza.com), in downtown Chicago.  
- [Outside Lands](http://outsidelands.org), in Golden Gate Park, San Franciso.  

The announcement of the band lineups at these huge festivals is often an event unto itself.  Music fans speculate feverishly ahead of time about whether their favorite bands will appear at a particular festival.

Some of these fans have pet theories about certain pairs of festivals---for example, that if a band plays at Lollapalooza, then it becomes relatively more likely to play at Austin City Limits.

The columns in the data set above tell you the name of the band, the year, and whether they played in a specific festival that year (1 for yes, 0 for no).  Can you find evidence for any of these theories in the data?  If a band plays at Lollapalooza, does it become more or less likely (relatively speaking) for that band to play at ACL in the same year?  What about the other festivals--do any of them predict whether a band is more likely to play at ACL?  

Explore the data and concisely summarize your conclusions, citing appropriate visual or numerical evidence.
